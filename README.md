# Database Management System for Exotic Car Rental Platform
Proposed organization is a car rental business that targets specific categories - exotic and premium cars. Unlike a typical rental car company, this organization does not own or lease cars for further rent out to customers, it only provides a platform that connects independent rental companies with people that are interested in renting those cars. The platform provides real-time availability and prices for all available cars based on customerâ€™s search parameters, manages bookings, takes care of all payments, insurance, accident reports and customer claims. Additionally, extra services are offered: concierge delivery service and chauffeur service.
